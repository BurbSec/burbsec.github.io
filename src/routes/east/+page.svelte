		Burbsec East is an informal meetup of Information Security enthusiasts,
		engineers, hackers, and general geeks! Expect a night of great networking and
		lubricated conversations! The crowd is very chill, about 30-70 strong, with
		experience levels ranging from college students through CISOs! We have NO
		DUES, NO PRESENTATIONS, and NO PUSHY SALESPEOPLE!

		Meeting at Navigator Taproom, it has over 40 beers on tap, along
		with many great ciders, wines, and cocktails, all using a self-serve RFID
		system! Aside from that, they also have a small you-call-it bar, and you can even
		have food delivered. Several food options exist within walking distance as well!
