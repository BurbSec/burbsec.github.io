What exactly is being sponsored is completely up to you. Most choose to just set a tab limit with the wait staff, sometimes only covering drinks.  Some sponsors also choose to pick up a few orders of finger foods, whereas others simply pick up the full tabs of whomever was in attendance until a set time. Completely up to you and what your sponsorship budget looks like. Be sure to take into consideration the location of the event you wish to sponsor as the costs can vary greatly.
