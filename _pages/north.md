BurbSec North is the Northern Suburb offshoot of the famous Chicagoland BurbSec
meetups. Information Security enthusiasts of all skill and career levels are
welcome to join us for a few beers and complaints about work (or the lack
thereof)! We average about 10-15 attendees each month, many of whom have been
coming for years! Our location offers excellent beers as well as a full pub
menu!

Don't forget we have a SPONSOR picking up drinks and snacks for SEPTEMBER,
OCTOBER, and NOVEMBER: BINALYZE!! Find out more about them at
