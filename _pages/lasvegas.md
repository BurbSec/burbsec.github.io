Burbsec Las Vegas is an informal meetup of Information Security enthusiasts,
engineers, hackers, and general geeks! Expect a night of great networking and
lubricated conversations! The crowd is very chill, with
experience levels ranging from college students through CISOs! We have NO
DUES, NO PRESENTATIONS, and NO PUSHY SALESPEOPLE!

Who needs dues when you can invest in upgrading your cyber skills? No presentations mean no snooze-fest – just pure, unadulterated cyber goodness! And don't worry, we've got a strict "No Pushy Salespeople or Recruiters" policy – we're here for the laughs, not the sales pitches.

TO BE ANNOUNCED - JAN 2025! Every XXX Thursday at XXXX in Las Vegas with plenty of free parking!
