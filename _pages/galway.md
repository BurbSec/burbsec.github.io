Burbsec Northwest is an informal meetup of Information Security enthusiasts,
engineers, hackers, geeks, tweaks, and weirdies! Expect a night of great
networking and lubricated conversations! The crowd is very chill, about 5-10
and growing, with experience levels ranging from college students through
veterans! We have NO DUES, NO PRESENTATIONS, and NO PUSHY SALESPEOPLE!

Crystal Lake Brewing, at the address below, has a full bar, but you will need
to BYO food if you need dinner.
