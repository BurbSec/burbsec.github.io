Burbsec Galway is an informal meetup of Information Security enthusiasts,
engineers, coders, hackers, geeks, and anyone interested in being more 
secure! Each month brings new discussions & maybe even some learning. 
We're still small but growing, with people from all walks of life or even
full-time security people! We have NO DUES and NO PUSHY SALESPEOPLE! Some
times we'll have a short presentation if someone is willing to share 
knowledge! Afterwards we may have a discussion on what was put together.

Keane's in Oranmore is the current location but discussions are in flight
for a possible move into Galway City proper.
