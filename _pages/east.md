Burbsec East is an informal meetup of Information Security enthusiasts,
engineers, hackers, and general geeks! Expect a night of great networking and
lubricated conversations! The crowd is very chill, about 30-40 strong, with
experience levels ranging from college students through CISOs! We have NO
DUES, NO PRESENTATIONS, and NO PUSHY SALESPEOPLE!

Navigator Taproom, at the address below. It has over 40 beers on tap, along
with many great ciders, wines, and cocktails, all using a self-serve RFID
system! Aside from that, they also have a small you-call-it bar, and you can
have food delivered from anywhere you like or pick it up from several great
options within walking distance.
