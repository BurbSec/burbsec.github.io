BurbSec South is the South Chicago burbs offshoot of the famous Chicagoland
BurbSec meetups. Information Security enthusiasts of all skill and career
levels are welcome to join us for a few beers and complaints about work (or
the lack thereof)! We average about 7-12 attendees each month, many of whom
have been coming for years! Our location offers excellent beers as well as a
full pub menu!

Finally, don't forget to join the BurbSec chat servers! Our Slack and Discord
are both synchronized with each other, so just choose whichever one you're
most comfortable with.
